<p> I am Angela Okuley, a vibrant and confident energy engineer with well-honed communication and technical skills. Ready to learn and fill my knowledge gap and to share experience acquired with a proven ability to work with people of diverse cultures.</p>
<p>I hold a BSc in Renewable Energy Engineering, from the University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani - Ghana and an MSc in Energy Engineering from the Pan African University Institute of Water and Energy Sciences (including Climate) , Tlemcen- Algeria. Presently, I work at the Ho Technical University, Ho - Ghana as an lecturer(assistant).</p>
<p>The future is Tech and the future is here. Though a lover of Energy, with research interests in Energy Efficiency, Energy Systems, Clean Energy, Climate Change, Sustainability. As an engineer, I can program in Python and C++, I like to play with Arduino and Photoshop when less occupied. My decision to study HTML is to design a website for some of my setups and to get some remote jobs for extra coins because there’ll always be people at the beautiful gate.</p>
<p>In the not-too-distant future, 5 years time max, I look forward to finishing my PhD in Energy Systems, undergoing impactful research and projects in Energy, speaking to, and solving global energy issues and an advocate for Women in Tech.</p>
